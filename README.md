This is the README file containing the workflow to construct this forensic geopragic cooridnate prediction pipeline.

The required input are available in *Data* directory.

All required packages in R are listed in packages.R

> Introduction. 

  This is an admixture-based pipeline to predict smaplesâ€˜ geographic coordinates in given test set. The pipeline applies the following general workflow:  
  * 1. Extract an AIM set from both training set and test set
  * 2. Calculate portions of pupative ancestral populations of traing set and test set repsectively, by ADMIXTURE in supervised mode.
  * 3. Predict the geographic coordinates for samples in test set based on the model trained by Random Forest using training set.   
  
  
> 1. AADR set data preparation
  Codes here are perfomed in Bash command. [PLINK 1.9](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/) is required. Since some of file sizes here are over the size limit on github, only the result files with the prefix *reich_here_overlap* are provided
  ```console
  # Get overlaps between ancestrial population set and AADR set
  plink --bfile ../Genographic/num_Admixture_reference_pops --extract reich_here.bim --make-bed --out genepool_overlap_SNP --noweb
  
  # keep only overlapped SNPs in AADR set
  plink --bfile reich_here --extract ../Genographic/num_Admixture_reference_pops.bim --make-bed --out reich_here_overlap --noweb
  ```
  
> 2. AIM set curation using AADR set 
Note: Only the final result files (in 2..) is provided in *Data* directory
* 2.1. Randomly split AADR samples into 2 based on a filtration criteria, do 100 times
  The filtration criteria:
  Before data splitting, countires having sample size < 5 should be discarded.
  During splitting, split smaples in each country into 2 sets in same size. If the sample size after splitting < 5, all samples in this country are put into training set. Otherwise, training set and test set will get random samples from this country in same size.
  Codes here are performed in R 4.1.2. 
  ```r
  # load meta
  meta <- read.csv('Data/meta_table') #nrow(meta)=14008
  # load sample tbl
  fam <- read.table('Data/reich_here_overlap.fam')[,2] 
  fam_file <- read.table('Data/reich_here_overlap.fam')
  meta <- meta[which(meta$Version.ID %in% fam),] 

  # remove countries having samples < 5
  ctry_count <- as.data.frame(table(meta$Country))
  smaller_than_five <- ctry_count$Var1[which(ctry_count$Freq<=5)]
  meta <- meta[-which(meta$Country %in% smaller_than_five ),] 
  ctry_count <- ctry_count[-which(ctry_count$Freq<=5),] 


  for(j in 1:100){
  sample_set1 <- c()
  sample_set2 <- c()
  
  # select half of samples from each country
   for(i in 1:nrow(ctry_count)){
     ctry <- ctry_count$Var1[i]
     ctry_sample <- meta$Version.ID[which(meta$Country == ctry)]
     split_size <- ceiling(length(ctry_sample)/2)
     if(split_size >= 5){ # if sample size after splitting < 5, all samples in this country are put into training set
       sample_set1 <- c(sample_set1, sample(ctry_sample, size = split_size))
       sample_set2 <- c(sample_set2, ctry_sample[-which(ctry_sample %in% sample_set1)])
     }else{ # if not, put into 2 sets
       sample_set1 <- c(sample_set1, ctry_sample)
     }
   }
   if(length(sample_set1) + length(sample_set2) == nrow(meta)){ # ensure no sample missing
     reference_sample <- fam_file[which(fam_file$V2 %in% sample_set1),]
     test_sample <- fam_file[which(fam_file$V2 %in% sample_set2),]
      
     # save them into file, ans save to a corresponding directory
     dir.create(paste0('dt',j))
     write.table(reference_sample, file = paste0('dt',j,'/reference_sample'),
                  quote = F, row.names = F, sep = '\t')
     write.table(test_sample, file = paste0('dt',j,'/test_sample'),
                  quote = F, row.names = F, sep = '\t')
   }else{
     message(nrow(reference_sample))
     message(nrow(test_sample))
     stop(paste0('In iteration ',j,', the sum of reference sample size and test sample size is not equal to the size of Reich dataset'))
   }
  
  
  }

  ```
  
  * 2.2. For each set of split AADR training and test sets:
     + 2.2.1. Extract samples for training set and test set
     Codes here are performed in R. PLINK 1.9 is required. *<num>* represents *the number of current set from 100 runs*
     
     ```r
     system('plink --bfile ../../reich_here_overlap --keep reference_sample --make-bed --out reference_reich --noweb')
     system('plink --bfile ../../reich_here_overlap --keep test_sample --make-bed --out test_reich --noweb')

     ```
